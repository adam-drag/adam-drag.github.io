Hey!

I'm a passionate software engineer with over 8 years of commercial experience. I've had the opportunity to work with prominent tech companies like Nokia and Capgemini, as well as contribute to an AI startup at Marqo. I'm a big fan of clean code; I believe that to move fast with a project, we, as software developers, need to write code with care, adhering to SOLID principles and ensuring it is as readable as possible. This is crucial; we spend ten times more time reading existing code than writing new lines.

**More About Me:**

I don't limit myself to one technology or language; instead, I love exploring new things and learning continuously. My project experience is diverse, ranging from contributing to microservice systems in Java and Spring Boot, working on a large-scale bank system in an OSGi architecture, to handling small to medium Node.js projects with frontend applications in the top three frameworks: Angular, React, and Vue.

While I've often played the role of a Full Stack developer, being the first to dive into new challenges, my primary expertise lies in backend development.

**In My Personal Life:**

Outside of work, I'm a dad who loves spending time with my family. When I'm not working or having fun with my boys, I enjoy reading books. Lately, I've been really into Stephen King's books, and I also like exploring The Legend of Drizzt (by the way, Baldur's Gate is my pick for the best game in the world). Another favorite of mine is Frank Herbert's Dune.
